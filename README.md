* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

```
npm install

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

npm start

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000'].
